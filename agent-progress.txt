Vex v1.2 - Object-Storage-First Search Engine
=============================================

PROJECT SUMMARY:
Open-source search engine (vector + full-text + hybrid) compatible with turbopuffer's
published API. Core language: Go. Object storage is the system of record.

IDENTIFIED TASKS: 112 tasks across all categories
- Infrastructure: 13 tasks (project setup, object store, API scaffolding, config, etc.)
- Functional: 71 tasks (write path, query path, indexing, caching, routing, etc.)
- API: 15 tasks (all endpoints matching turbopuffer's HTTP API surface)
- Testing: 13 tasks (unit, golden, simulation, fault injection, compat suite)

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
1. Phase 0: Go module, object store abstraction, API scaffolding
2. Phase 1: WAL + strong reads (namespace state, write API, tail, query)
3. Phase 2: Warm routing + cache (rendezvous hashing, NVMe/RAM cache)
4. Phase 3: ANN indexing (IVF centroid index, indexer process)
5. Phase 4: Filter indexes (roaring bitmaps, recall-aware filtering)
6. Phase 5: Full-text + hybrid (BM25, multi-query)
7. Phase 6: Polish (aggregations, namespace ops, schema rebuilds)

FIRST TASK: project-setup
Working agent should start with init.sh to scaffold Go project structure.

KEY DEPENDENCIES:
- Object storage (S3-compatible, MinIO for local dev)
- Go 1.21+ recommended for modern features
- Protobuf for WAL encoding, zstd for compression
- Roaring bitmaps for filter indexes
